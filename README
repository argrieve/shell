Description
-----------
This is a basic UNIX shell project from an undergraduate operating systems
course. It supports several built-in commands (listed below), and uses the
typical fork and wait approach for other commands. It also supports executing
child processes in the background using an ampersand (&) and redirecting output
from stdout to a file using the greater than (>) symbol.

The built-in commands are:
  help - prints the help message
  exit - the shell terminates
  pid  - the shell prints its process ID
  ppid - the shell prints its parent's process ID
  pwd  - print the current working directory
  cd <dir>  - change the working directory to <dir>
  get <var> - prints the value of the environment variable <var>
  set <var> <value> - set environment variable <var> to <value>

The shell prompt can be changed using the '-p' switch, followed by a new value
to use as the prompt. Additionally, the '-h' switch will display the help 
message.

The shell does minimal input validation - use at your own risk.
